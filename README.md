## Sign Language Translation Tool
The Sign Language Translation Tool is an AI-powered application designed to interpret sign language gestures into text or speech in real-time using a webcam. By combining computer vision and machine learning, it aims to enhance communication for the hearing-impaired community, promoting accessibility and inclusion. This tool uses hand tracking and gesture recognition to translate signs efficiently, making it a valuable step toward bridging the communication gap between signers and non-signers.

## Purpose
This project aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the rest of society by translating sign language gestures into readable or audible text. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning, the tool provides real-time recognition and translation of sign language gestures, promoting inclusivity and accessibility.

## Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language for backend logic and data processing.
OpenCV – For capturing and processing video frames.
MediaPipe – For efficient hand tracking and landmark detection.
TensorFlow / Keras – To train and deploy the machine learning model for gesture classification.
Streamlit / Flask – For building an interactive user interface (optional).
NumPy & Pandas – For data manipulation and preprocessing.
## Usage
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-translation-tool.git
cd sign-language-translation-tool
## Conclusion
This Sign Language Translation Tool is a step forward in making communication more inclusive for the hearing-impaired community. It serves as a foundation for future advancements in gesture recognition and real-time language translation. Future improvements could include supporting full sentence translation, regional sign languages, and integration into mobile platforms.
